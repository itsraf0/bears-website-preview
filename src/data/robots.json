Lenny Grabitz featured an arm rotation and extension with an end effector capable of handling both cubes and cones. The Cube Hammer showcased a redesigned game piece handling inspired by 2022, incorporating a shooter, tilt, and turret. Both robots shared an over-bumper intake and utilized April Tags for advanced localization and targeting. It was a massive effort with our rookie cohort and returning members!",
