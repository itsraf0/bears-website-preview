Driver station
The term Driver station can be used to describe the laptop's we use to operate the robot or the software that runs on them. The laptop's are used only for operating the robot and should not be used for anything else. The driver station software is the software that runs on the driver station laptops and communicates and controls the state of the robot such as setting operating mode and enabling/disabling the robot.
